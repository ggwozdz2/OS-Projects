# OS-Projects

Projects created during "Operating systems" (Systemy operacyjne) during the academic year 2022/23 at University of Warsaw.

Throughout this course, we have learned how operating systems work, especially unix systems like MINIX.

Solution to the first two tasks (inverse, core)  written in Assembly x86_64.

Solutions to tasks payments and wait were patches to [MINIX operating system](https://github.com/Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix) (however the version that we used during classes had a bit different source code).


My scores:

| TASK           | POINTS            | 
| :------------: | :------------:    |
| **inverse**     |  **4.6** / 5 _pt_ |
| **core**	   | **5** / 5 _pt_ |
| **payments** | **5** / 5 _pt_ |
| **wait** | **5** / 5 _pt_
